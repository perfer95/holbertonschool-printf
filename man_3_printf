PRINTF(3)

NAME
       _printf - print formatted output

SYNOPSIS
       #include "main.h"

       int _printf(const char *format, ...);
       void print_char(char c, int *p_count);
       void print_string(char *s, int *p_count);
       void print_integer(int n, int *p_count);

DESCRIPTION
       The _printf() function writes output to stdout, according to the format string format. It processes the format string and calls the appropriate function to print each component based on the format specifier.

       The print_char() function prints a single character to stdout. It takes the character to be printed as input along with a pointer to an integer to count the number of characters printed.

       The print_string() function prints a string of characters to stdout. It takes the string to be printed as input along with a pointer to an integer to count the number of characters printed.

       The print_integer() function prints an integer to stdout. It takes the integer to be printed as input along with a pointer to an integer to count the number of characters printed.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful return, _printf() returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings). The print_char(), print_string(), and print_integer() functions do not return a value.

FORMAT SPECIFIERS
       The format string passed to _printf() can include the following format specifiers:

       %c     Print a single character.

       %s     Print a string of characters.

       %d, %i Print an integer in base 10.

       %%     Print a literal % character.

EXAMPLES
       _printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
           Prints: Hello, world!

       _printf("The number is %d\n", 42);
           Prints: The number is 42

       _printf("Printing a percent sign: %%\n");
           Prints: Printing a percent sign: %

	_printf("The integer is: %i\n", 1024);
           Prints: The integer is: 1024

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful return, _printf() returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings). The functions print_char(), print_string(), and print_integer() do not return a value.

NOTES
       The _printf() function only covers certain functionalities of the printf function, therefore, not all the qualities that were originally implemented are expected
